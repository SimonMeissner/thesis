\chapter*{Abstract}
Interaction techniques are ways of inducing interactivity in visualizations. This includes the field of geo-dashboards.
Focusing on them is one approach to deriving lacking design recommendations that facilitate user performance in geo-dashboards.
Because interaction techniques depend on the specific user interaction we will focus on the common
visualization task \textit{comparison}, mentioned in many different interaction taxonomies. Analyzing collected data on user
performance from a conducted study could not deliver a quantitative model that encodes the influence of all involved variables.
The analysis confirmed some qualitative differences in user performance regarding the number of comparative elements and the type
of comparative task. The analysis could not reveal any differences in user performance comparing the broadly used interaction techniques
\textit{highlighting} and \textit{filtering}. More research with a larger sample size focusing on fewer variables at a time is
advised to help find quantitative differences and derive mathematical models describing the user performance when solving comparative
tasks in the context of geo-dashboards.
