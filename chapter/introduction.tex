\chapter{Introduction}
The growing usage of dashboards to represent data across a range of different 
fields suggests a need for research on layout and design features of dashboards 
and their influence on the user experience. Previous research has shown that there is
no one-fits-all solution for the design of dashboards \citep*{Yigitbasioglu.2012,Sarikaya.2018}.

This existing agreement that general design recommendations for dashboards are not sufficient
and/or possible ask for a breakdown of components that constitute dashboards. One approach is
to identify user interactions that are possible when visualized data is explored or analysed.
The field of geovisualizations and geodashboards is enriched with many different perspectives that
all try to define taxonomies and or classifications models for possible user interactions
\citep*{Andrienko.2003,Crampton.2002}. Many have their reasonable own application for
spatial-temporal information visualization. But the minority of these classifications and
taxonomies are empirically-derived. The proposed framework of Roth represents an exception.
He has shown that a functional taxonomy of interaction primitives can be empirically derived.
He identified general tasks users want to accomplish (objective primitives) \citep{Roth.2013}.
Besides narrowing down the scope to one of Roths derived objective primitives this work will also
look at this topic from the perspective of different interaction techniques.

An interaction technique as broadly defined in the Computer Science Handbook from 2004
is "the fusion of input and output, consisting of all hardware and software elements, 
that provides a way for the user to accomplish a task." \citep*{Hinckley.2004}. Input describes
all sensed information about the physical environment to the computer. Output from computers on the
other hand include any emission or modification to the physical environment. In the
context of geovisualizations and geodashboards, interaction techniques have been
researched \citep*{Keim.2005,Lobo.2015,vanTonder.2011}.
Roth also describes an interaction technique in the context of geovisualizations as the
functionality of an given interface and the procedures of manipulating its
visualizations \citep{Roth.2013}.

This work will deal with the derived objective primitive of \textit{comparison} from Roth's work.
But not only Roth writes about comparison. Wehrend describes \textit{compare} as a seperate
operation class in visualization problem \citep{Wehrend.1990} and Brehmer et al.
speak of comparison as a low level visualization task \citep*{Brehmer.2013}. In the
scope of geovisualizations Crampton identified \textit{compare} as an interactivity task
\citep{Crampton.2002} and Gorte and Degbelo argue that \textit{comparison} is a basic
task that is relevant in exploratoy and confirmatory analysis \citep{Gorte.2022}.
Buja distingiushes between two dimensions of comparison. The first
describes the goal of comparing different variables or projections of the whoel dataset.
The second describes the goal of comparing subsets of the whole dataset against each
other \citep*{Buja.1996}. This work will only focus on the latter. 

We will examine two broadly used interaction techniques: \textit{filtering} and
\textit{highlighting} \citep*{Keim.2005,Roth.2013}. Keim et al. describe \textit{filtering} as a
combination of selection and view enhancement and Roth attributes filtering to identifying matches
from user-defined conditions. The literature often use the term \textit{brushing} 
to describe \textit{highlighting}. They can be considered synonymous in the scope of interaction techniques
as both describe the process of visualy emphasizing a subset from the whole dataset.
Historically to define the subset the process started by drawing a rectangle directly in the view with the
mouse which was called \textit{brush}. Which explains the term \textit{brushing}.
For the rest of this work we will use the term \textit{highlighting}. Keim et al. state
that \textit{highlighting} is often combined with linking which describes the process of selected data
beeing communicated to other views of the data. They follow one of the proposed user strategies
\textit{Select Subset} from Gleichner \citep*{Gleicher.2018}.

In this work we will investigate how these interaction techniques influence user performance
in the context of comparing subsets in geodashboards. Because the interaction technique is
by far not the only variable that can be changed, we also want to observe the influence of
different variables on the user performance. To provide a starting point backed with emperical
data we want to derive a mathematical model that should display user performance in dependence
from different variables which are described later. Therefore we can infer two research
questions for this work:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Which mathematical models best describe user performance during the comparison of spatial entities
    in the context of geodashboards?
    \item Which interaction technique best supports the task of comparison in the context of
    geodashboards? 
\end{enumerate}

To answer these questions we conducted a user study in which participants try to answer
questions with the goal of finding differences and/or similarities of subsets
of spatial-/temporal datasets. To answer the
questions they are using a specially builded digital web-prototype with six different dashboard
variants. The dashboards vary in their interaction technique and some render additional views
utilizing \textit{explicit encoding} as it is defined as one of the basic designs for visual
comparison \citep*{Gleicher.2018}. The goal of the experiment is to collect data about the user
performance. We have defined user performance to include the time it takes to answer questions
and the accuracy of that answer. After that we want to use that data to derive mathematical
models that best approximate answer time and accuracy during the comparison of features in
geodashboards. With special interest for the differences between the selected interaction
techniques. We want to learn about the different factors we have included and how they
influence answer time and accuracy in this setting.

To get an overview of the current state of research, chapter 2 will provide information
about scientific contributions on interaction techniques in geo-dashboards and comparison.
We will also give an short introduction to multiple coordinated because we are utilizing
such a system in our prototype. Section 3 will describe key concepts of the mathematical models and
what constitues them. In Section 4 details about the digital web-prototype and how it was built are presented.
How the experiment was designed and what factors that possibly influence comparison performance were considered
are covered in section 5. Section 6 will present the results of the experiment and propose our found
mathematical models that showed the best testing results.
As this experiment only covers a selection of possible factors that possible influence difficulty and
accuracy during the comparison of features in geodashboards, this work should be a starting point for
further research. Because comparison can be of many different kinds and cover different scopes this work
also opens the door for more reseach in different comparison settings. Section 7 discusses such limitations
in depth, how our research questions can be answered and how our findings can be transferred to other domains.
Lastly we will sumarize our key-learnings and propose future work that has to be done in section 8.
