\chapter{User Study}

\section{Goal}
The goal of the study was to find mathematical models that approximate user performance best. In our definition user
performance is two-folded: answer time and accuracy. We hope to learn something about the impact the interaction technique
has on these two parameters. The findings refer to the comparison of features in geo-dashboards.
\section{Variables}
We wanted to include several independent variables to get a rough idea of which factors would affect user performance and
which would not. We also had to make sure that we gather enough observations per independent variable. That is the second
reason we included multiple independent variables. We included the number of views the dashboard renders, the number of
spatial entities that are compared simultaneously, the interaction technique the dashboard used and the type of comparison
question that was asked.
