    01 & \parbox{\linewidth}{\vspace{4pt}The app should visualize one spatial-temporal dataset with polygons on a map. Each polygon should represent a spatial entity} & Functional\\
    \hline
    02 & \parbox{\linewidth}{\vspace{4pt}The app should allow the user to read the exact attribute value for every spatial entity over the whole time period in a separate view} & Functional\\
    \hline
    03 & \parbox{\linewidth}{\vspace{4pt}The app should visualize the temporal evolution for the attribute values of all spatial entities at a glance in a separate view} & Functional\\
    \hline
    04 & \parbox{\linewidth}{\vspace{4pt}The app eases the process of comparing two (or three) spatial entities through a comparison mode that can be switched on/off} & Functional\\
    \hline
    05 & \parbox{\linewidth}{\vspace{4pt}The app should provide six different dashboard versions that differ in their interaction technique and number of rendered views for comparing spatial entities} & Functional\\
    \hline
    06 & \parbox{\linewidth}{\vspace{4pt}The app consists of version 1 where in comparison mode only the selected entities are filtered and shown in all views. It represents a 'filtering' interaction technique} & Functional\\
    \hline
    07 & \parbox{\linewidth}{\vspace{4pt}The app consists of version 2 where in comparison mode the selected entities are visually emphasized using one color. It represents a 'highlighting' interaction technique} & Functional\\
    \hline
    08 & \parbox{\linewidth}{\vspace{4pt}The app consists of version 3 where in comparison mode the selected entities are visually emphasized using multiple colors. One for each entity. It represents a 'highlighting' interaction technique} & Functional\\
    \hline
    09 & \parbox{\linewidth}{\vspace{4pt}The app consists of version 4 which is a copy of version 1 described in requirement 06. In addition, one more view that meets requirement 02 and one more view that meets requirement 03 are displayed in comparison mode. These additional views encode the subtracted values of the selected entities forming views that encode 'differences'. For every combination of the selected entities one additional data series is displayed.} & Functional\\
    \hline
    10 & \parbox{\linewidth}{\vspace{4pt}The app consists of version 5 which is a copy of version 2 described in requirement 07. In addition, one more view that meets requirement 02 and one more view that meets requirement 03 are displayed in comparison mode. These additional views encode the subtracted values of the selected entities forming views that encode 'differences'. For every combination of the selected entities one additional data series is displayed.} & Functional\\
    \hline
    11 & \parbox{\linewidth}{\vspace{4pt}The app consists of version 6 which is a copy of version 3 described in requirement 06. In addition, one more view that meets requirement 02 and one more view that meets requirement 03 are displayed in comparison mode. These additional views encode the subtracted values of the selected entities forming views that encode 'differences'. For every combination of the selected entities one additional data series is displayed. In line with version 6, which represents a highlighting interaction technique with individual colors, the rendered differences are also visually highlighted in different colors.} & Functional\\
    \hline
    12 & \parbox{\linewidth}{\vspace{4pt}In all six versions in comparison mode all selected spatial entities are highlighted on the map.} & Functional\\
    \hline
    13 & \parbox{\linewidth}{\vspace{4pt}The app enables the user to switch between four selected datasets which all have the same spatial-temporal dimensions} & Functional\\
    \hline
    14 & \parbox{\linewidth}{\vspace{4pt}The app should be available over a website} & Non-Functional\\
    \hline
    15 & \parbox{\linewidth}{\vspace{4pt}The app should be user-friendly and have fast loading times} & Non-Functional\\
    \hline
    16 & \parbox{\linewidth}{\vspace{4pt}The app should use multi-coordinated views appropriately by paying attention to common guidelines to reduce cognitive overhead.} & Non-Functional\\
